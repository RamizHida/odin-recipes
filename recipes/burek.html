    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 potato, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Brown ground beef in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat, 5 to 7
        minutes. Drain fat; stir in allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper.
        Transfer beef to a large bowl and stir in potato and onion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unroll phyllo pastry and transfer 2 sheets to a work surface; stack
        sheets. Spoon 1/8th of the ground beef mixture down one long edge of the
        phyllo pastry. Roll phyllo into a tube, encasing beef. Shape the tube
        into a coil (snail shape). Place the roll on an ungreased baking sheet;
        brush with melted butter. Repeat, placing finished rolls up against one
        another to keep them from unrolling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake burek in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
