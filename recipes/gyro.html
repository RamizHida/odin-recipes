    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      A gyro sandwich, <em>according to Michael Pollick</em>, consists of
      various rotisseried meats, salad vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce and
      onions, along with a yogurt-based tzatziki sauce. These ingredients are
      placed on a hearty form of grilled pita bread and served as a wrap
      sandwich.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 small onion, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>and many more...</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place onion in a food processor and blend until finely chopped. Transfer
        onion to a piece of cheese cloth and squeeze out the liquid. Place onion
        in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix lamb, beef, garlic, oregano, cumin, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, black
        pepper, and salt with the onion using your hands until well mixed. Cover
        bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, about 2
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

      <li>
        Place meat mixture in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped
        and tacky, about 1 minute. Pack meat mixture into a 7x4-inch loaf pan,
        ensuring there are no air pockets. Place loaf pan into a roasting pan
        and pour enough boiling water around the loaf pan to reach halfway up
        the sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Pour off any accumulated fat
        and cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>Thinly slice the gyro meat mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 tablespoon hummus onto each pita bread; top each with gyro meat
        mixture, lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
